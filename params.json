There are sites that offer this service but I wanted myself control the deposit of my files.\r\nThe idea is to do a project with the simplest possible without source code framework and without reinventing the wheel. I use [jquery](https://jquery.com) and [dropzonejs](http://www.dropzonejs.com) as third application.\r\n\r\n### Required\r\n- a web server (of course!)\r\n- php 5.6 or up\r\n- MySQL\r\n\r\n### Install\r\nInstallation is very simple.\r\n- Transfer the project to the root of your site (i.e: www / bfs)\r\n- Create a directory that will upload files with write access by www-data (or apache)\r\n- Setup config.ini\r\n\r\n### Custon thumb\r\nIf you want custom thumb preview juste edit index.php, add extension in array (line 125-150)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with BFS? contact me [contact support](mailto:contact@beemoon.fr) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
